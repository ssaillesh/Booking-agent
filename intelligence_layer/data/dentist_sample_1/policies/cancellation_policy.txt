Cancellation Policy

1. Notice
Patients must provide at least 24 hours’ notice to cancel or reschedule routine appointments. Notice should be given by phone, email, or through the patient portal where available. Cancellations or rescheduling requests made with 24 hours or less notice may be classified as late cancellations.

2. No-Shows and Late Cancellations
A no-show is a missed appointment with no prior notice. Late cancellations are cancellations received within 24 hours of the scheduled appointment. The clinic reserves the right to charge a cancellation fee for late cancellations and no-shows. Repeated no-shows or repeated late cancellations may lead to additional measures as described in section 4.

3. Deposits and Prepayment
For patients with a history of repeated no-shows or for certain high-demand procedures, the clinic may require a deposit or prepayment to confirm future bookings. Deposits:
- Will be requested at the time of booking when applicable.
- Will be applied to the total cost of the scheduled treatment.
- Are refundable if the appointment is cancelled with at least 24 hours’ notice.
- May be forfeited, in part or full, for late cancellations or no-shows as determined by the clinic’s fee schedule.

4. Repeated No-Shows
Repeated no-shows or multiple late cancellations within a short period (as determined by the clinic) may result in:
- Requirement of deposits or full prepayment for future appointments.
- Restriction to emergency or walk-in services only.
- Referral to another provider if reliable scheduling cannot be maintained.

5. Late Arrival
If a patient arrives late, the appointment may be shortened or rescheduled to avoid impacting other patients. If rescheduling is required due to late arrival, a late-cancellation fee may apply.

6. Exceptions
We recognize that emergencies, sudden illness, or unforeseen events occur. Exceptions to fees or deposit requirements may be made at the clinic’s discretion for documented emergencies, severe illness, bereavement, or extreme weather/transportation disruptions. Patients should notify the clinic as soon as possible in such cases.

7. Cancellation by the Clinic
If the clinic must cancel an appointment (e.g., provider emergency, unforeseen closure), we will notify patients promptly and assist with rescheduling. Deposits or prepayments will be refunded or applied to the rescheduled appointment.

8. Payment and Disputes
Any applicable cancellation fees or deposit forfeitures will be billed to the patient. Questions or disputes about charges should be directed to the clinic’s billing or reception team for review.

9. Policy Changes
This policy may be updated periodically. Patients will be notified of significant changes; the clinic’s reception or patient portal will have the current policy.
