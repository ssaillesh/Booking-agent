Working Hours Policy — Dental Clinic

Purpose
This document defines standard operating hours, holiday closures, and after-hours emergency procedures to ensure consistent patient access and staff expectations.

Scope
Applies to all clinical, administrative, and on-call staff and to patients scheduling appointments or seeking urgent care.

Regular Hours
- Monday to Saturday: 09:00 — 18:00
- No routine appointments are scheduled on Sundays.

Holidays and Observed Closures
- The clinic is closed for routine appointments on all statutory/federal holidays. Commonly observed holidays include:
    - New Year's Day (January 1)
    - Good Friday (date varies)
    - Victoria Day (Monday preceding May 25)
    - Canada Day (July 1; observed on Monday if July 1 falls on a Sunday)
    - Labour Day (first Monday in September)
    - Thanksgiving Day (second Monday in October)
    - Remembrance Day (November 11; observed where applicable)
    - Christmas Day (December 25)
    - Boxing Day (December 26)
- The clinic also observes province-specific statutory holidays (e.g., Family Day, Civic Holiday). Staff will follow the provincially applicable holiday schedule.
- If a statutory holiday falls on a weekend and the province designates an alternative observed day, the clinic will follow the designated observed day.

Emergency and After-Hours Care
- No routine appointments will be scheduled outside regular hours or on statutory holidays.
- Emergency cases may be handled outside normal hours at the discretion of the on-call dentist.
- The on-call dentist will triage emergency calls, provide advice, and determine whether an in-clinic emergency visit is required.
- Patients should use the clinic’s after-hours emergency contact number for urgent dental issues (pain, uncontrolled bleeding, significant swelling, trauma).
- If the on-call dentist determines an in-person emergency visit is necessary, staff will coordinate an appropriate appointment time and ensure necessary personnel and resources are available.

Scheduling, Cancellations and Rescheduling
- Regular appointment scheduling is available during office hours (09:00–18:00, Mon–Sat).
- Patients are asked to provide at least 24 hours' notice for cancellations whenever possible.
- Appointments missed without appropriate notice may be subject to the clinic's missed-appointment policy.

Staff Responsibilities
- Administrative staff will post and communicate holiday closures and any planned deviations from regular hours at least 30 days in advance when possible.
- The on-call dentist will maintain an accessible contact method and a schedule for after-hours coverage.
- All staff will follow public safety and provincial health guidance for emergency closures (e.g., extreme weather, public health orders).

Communication and Notices
- Holiday and closure schedules will be posted at the clinic, on the clinic website, and via any established patient communication channels.
- For the most current list of observed closures, patients should contact the clinic or check the clinic website; provincial holiday observances may change annually.

Exceptions
- In exceptional circumstances (public health emergency, extreme weather, staffing emergency), the clinic may modify hours, postpone routine care, or redirect patients to emergency services. The clinic will communicate changes as promptly as possible.

Review
- This policy will be reviewed annually or as required by operational changes or regulatory updates.
