Appointment Duration Policy — Dentistry

Purpose
To standardize appointment lengths for clinical accuracy, patient flow, and required sterilization between patients.

Scope
Applies to all clinical bookings at the practice (dentists, hygienists, oral surgeons, and dental assistants).

Scheduling Rules (general)
- Clinic booking granularity: 15-minute increments.
- Every booked patient block must include a 15-minute buffer after the clinical procedure for room turnover and sterilization. The buffer is separate from procedure time and cannot be omitted except in documented emergencies.
- If multiple procedures are booked in one visit, appointment length = sum of individual procedure durations + one 15-minute turnover buffer.
- If combined procedures exceed typical block sizes, book the next larger contiguous block (do not split across non-consecutive slots).
- New patient or extended consultations should be scheduled with additional time to allow medical history, exam, and treatment planning.
- Emergency/urgent patients: schedule a 15-minute triage; if treatment is performed same day, book appropriate full procedure time plus buffer.
- Booking staff must confirm expected procedure(s) at time of booking and inform patient of total visit duration including buffer.

Standard Procedure Durations (includes clinical time only; add 15-minute buffer)
- Routine check-up / recall exam: 30 minutes
- Dental prophylaxis (hygiene scaling and polish): 45–60 minutes (45 min pediatric/adult quick, 60 min adult full)*
- Fillings (simple, one-surface): 45 minutes
- Fillings (multi-surface): 60–75 minutes (adjust per complexity)
- Root canal (single canal anterior): 60–90 minutes; molar root canals: 90–150 minutes depending on canals/complexity
- Crown preparation: 90 minutes
- Crown delivery/placement: 60 minutes
- Surgical extraction (impacted or complex): 120 minutes
- Simple extraction: 30–45 minutes
- Implant placement (single): 120–180 minutes (includes setup, anesthesia, placement; staging and restoration visits scheduled separately)
- Periodontal maintenance or scaling with root planing: 60–90 minutes (per quadrant or as clinically indicated)
- Sedation/general anesthesia cases: add pre-op assessment time (30–60 minutes) and recovery/monitoring time (minimum 30 minutes) in addition to procedure time
- Radiographs and intraoral scans: 10–20 minutes (add to appointment length as required)
- Digital impressions/scan for lab work: 15–30 minutes

Booking Examples
- Routine check-up + fluoride: 30 (check-up) + 15 (fluoride) = 45 minutes + 15-minute buffer → book 60 minutes
- Filling (single-surface) + radiographs: 45 + 15 = 60 + 15-minute buffer → book 75 minutes (round to nearest 15-min increment → 75)

Overruns & Notifications
- If a clinician overruns, reception should notify the next patient as soon as possible and offer options: wait, reschedule, or partial treatment if clinically appropriate.
- Buffer time is intended to reduce overruns; staff should not routinely schedule back-to-back without buffer.

Cancellations & Rescheduling
- Patients must provide at least 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling for routine appointments; longer notice may be required for surgical or sedation cases.
- Cancellations within 24 hours may be subject to clinic cancellation policy/fees.

Exceptions
- Clinical judgement can override standard times for complex or unusual cases; when this occurs, document the reason and book appropriate extended time.
- Pediatric, special-needs, and anxious patients often require additional chair time—add at least 15–30 minutes depending on needs.

Review
- This policy will be reviewed annually or as clinical practice changes dictate.

*Adjust prophylaxis duration based on patient periodontal status and clinician assessment.
